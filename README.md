# RAG LLM Development Guidebook from PDFs

This repository accompanies the guidebook, *"Developing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems from PDFs: A Practical Guide"*, which is available on [arXiv].

The repository contains the source code for implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using two distinct approaches:

1. **[OpenAI’s Assistant API (GPT Series)](./4.1-OpenAI-GPT-API)** – Code related to using GPT-based models from OpenAI for RAG systems.
2. **[LLaMA (Open-Source LLM)](./4.2-LLaMA-OpenSource-LLM)** – Code for developing RAG systems using LLaMA, an open-source Large Language Model.

## How to Use

### 1. OpenAI’s Assistant API (GPT Series)
Navigate to the `4.1-OpenAI-GPT-API` folder for code related to the integration of OpenAI’s GPT models. This approach offers a simple and developer-friendly API, allowing for quick integration without extensive model management.

### 2. LLaMA (Open-Source LLM)
For LLaMA-based RAG systems, explore the `4.2-LLaMA-OpenSource-LLM` folder. This method provides full control over the model architecture, training data, and fine-tuning, offering flexibility and customization options for specific use cases.
